Students should know the rules they are going to follow and the benefits of following the covid-19 Safety Rules in the School Classroom. If students and teachers follow these basic rules, the spread can be stopped and schools can reopen. Classes were switched from offline to online at night but it created confusion among students, especially the ones that were about to enter college. Students should never sneeze on their hands, rather they should cover them with their elbows, or may use a tissue or a handkerchief. Students even took a gap year hoping for the situation to get better.
